# O
- STM & Code Review (`Prompt practice`)
- Individual & Structured prompt coding practice

# R
Grateful & Reflective
- "Many hands make light work", when I raise a question in STM, I received the help of teammates and felt the strength of the team.
- Knowing that we should use AI without affecting our original workflow.
# I
- Learned how to use prompt template to interact with Ai to get better results.
- Master how to create value beyond code by business perspective
- AI is just a navigator, not a driver. Improving ourselves is what we really need to do.

# D
- More teamwork instead of working alone in the next time.
- Build my own prompt framework and repository
